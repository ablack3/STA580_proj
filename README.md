# STA580_proj

This is the final project for the USM biostatistics class STA 580 prepared by Adam Black and Andrew Deighan. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate whether or not there is a relationship between insurance status of individuals and their propensity to be proactive in their own health care. 

To this end we directed or study down two specific avenues:

- Associations between insurance status and use of a primary care physician
- Associations between primary care and diagnosis of chronic illness.

The data used for this analysis was acquired from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) reports compiled by the CDC. These reports are freely available at the CDC website: [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)
