# Introduction


  Utilization of primary healthcare has been shown time and time again to improve health outcomes and lower costs. Primary care is the single most important aspect of a health system, able to act as the initial access point to the healthcare system as a whole, and to fulfill the majority of people's needs.[These are strong claims. Do we have a citation to back them up?] Even in cases where specialized care is needed, better health outcomes are regularly acheived when this specialized care is coordinated through a primary care provider [@PrimaryCare]. From the county level to the national level, accessibility to primary care is strongly associated with increased general health along with decreased mortality rates, hospital admissions, overall healthcare system costs, and socieoeconomic disparities [@PrimaryCare].


In the years following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) the uninsured rate has dropped from around 15% in 2010 to around 9% in 2015. Insurance coverage is thought to be associated with greater access to primary care which is linked with better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. We are interested in how presence of insurance is linked with utilization of primary care and the subsequent diagnois of chronic illness. We examined data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillence System (BRFSS), 2011-2015, collected by the CDC. This survey is collected continuously by the CDC and asks respondents a variety of questions about their health status.

  In March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law. One of the primary objectives of this legislation was to decrease the uninsured rate in the United States. Although some reforms began in 2010 directly after the signing of the bill, most major reforms did not take effect until 2014 [@ACA]. Beginning in 2014 the government funded Medicaid program was expanded in many states, new private insurance marketplaces selling government subsidized insurance plans were opened, and new consumer protections were placed on private insurance companies. During the first open-enrollment period of the ACA (Oct 1st 2013 through April 15th 2014) an estimated 20 million Americans gained insurance under the ACA. In roughly the same period of time the uninsured rate dropped from around 18% to about 13.4% [@ACA]. Since then the uninsured rate has continued to steadily drop, down to an estimated 9.1% in 2015 [@Census].
  
  With this recent boost in the proportion of Americans with health insurance come important questions about the overall effects of more people having health insurance. We aim to investigate the relationship between insurance status, utilization of primary care, and subsequent diagnosis of chronic illness in the United States. If insurance status is indeed linked to increased utilization of primary care then the reduction in the uninsured rate could herald future overall improvement of health outcomes and decreases in costs. However if greater use of primary care leads to overdiagnosis of chronic illness the resulting effect on chronic illness could be quite the opposite.

# Methods

### Data

  The data used in this study were directly taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annual surveys from 2011 through 2015. The BRFSS survey is a joint effort between individual state and territory health departments and the CDC [@BRFSS]. Every year, each state does a land-line and cell-phone survey of selected telephone numbers of residents in their state and asks a set of questions. The core questions asked by each state are the same. The data used in this study came from responses to core questions of the BRFSS Survey that all states were asked. Any refusals to respond or responses of "Unsure/Don't Know" for the response variable or any of the explanatory variables of interest were ignored. Thus, only full responses were included. However, the data sets are large so the fraction of incomplete responses was negligble.


  Our study uses data from the 2011 through 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annual surveys. We will be looking at the association between insurance status and three measures: whether or not an individual has a personal doctor, the frequency of general health checkups for all individuals, and the frequency of general health checkups for individuals that have a personal doctor.


  For analysis at the nation level we used three questions asked in the BRFSS survey: one to pertaining to insurance status (our explanatory variable), one about whether or not an individual has a personal doctor, and one asking how long it has been since their last general health checkup. The personal doctor and time since last checkup responses are the variables that we use as measures of primary care access and utilization. 

1. Insurance Status: Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as Medicare, or Indian Health Service?
    + 1: Yes      2: No       7: Don't know/Not Sure        9: Refused
2. Personal Doctor: Do you have one person you think of as your personal doctor or health care provider? (If "No" ask "Is there more than one or is there no person who you think of as your personal doctor or health care provider?".)
      + 1: Yes, only one      2: More than one  3: No 7: Don't know/Not Sure  9: Refused
3. Doctor Utilization: About how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup? [A routine checkup is a general physical exam, not an exam for a specific injury, illness, or condition.]
    + 1: Within past year (anytime less than 12 months ago)
    + 2: Within past 2 years (1 year but less than 2 years ago)
    + 3: Within past 5 years (2 years but less than 5 years ago)
    + 4: 5 or more years ago
    + 7: Don't know/Not sure
    + 8: Never
    + 9: Refused  
<br>
<br>
    
  From the above questions we organized three different measures that we considered For this part of the study we considered three measures as proxies of primary care access and utilization:

* Personal Doctor: Whether or not an individual reported having a personal doctor
    + Two Levels:
        - Personal doctor
        - No personal doctor
* Doctor Utilization: The reported period of time since last general checkup. We only looked at two levels for this part of the analysis. For information on all levels see appendix.
    + Two Levels:
        - Within the past year
        - Not within the past five years (aggregate of the responses: "5 or more years ago" and "Never")
* Doctor Utilization given Personal Doctor: Same as above, but only considering individuals who reported having a personal doctor
    + Two Levels:
        - Within the past year
        - Not within the past five years
<br>

4. have you ever been told you have X?
yes or no


5. What is your general health status.


### Statistical analysis
We examine four associations.
insurance~doc
indsurcanc~checkup
insurance~checkup|doc
doc~chronic illness diagnosis


the first three relationsips is described by a 2x2 table and was examined using the following statistical methods
chisquared test of association
rank correlation measures (gamma &tau b)
relative risk
absolute risk difference

The final association was examined for each chronic illness using relative risk stratified by age and income.
logistic regression was also used.


# Results

## PCP ~ Insurance

Figure 1 shows the proportion of insured and uninsured individuals with a personal doctor for years 2011 through 2015 and all years combined.

![**Figure 1:** The proportion of insured and uninsured individuals who reported having a personal doctor.](./plots/Proportion_of_Individuals_with_a_Personal_Doctor.png)


It is evident from figure 1 that the proportion of individuals that have a personal doctor is higher for those with insurance than those without and that this relationsip is consistent from 2011 through 2015. 

```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- data.frame(Estimate = c("0.396  [0.395, 0.397]", "0.790  [0.787, 0.792]"))
row.names(tabl) <- c("Tau-b", "Gamma")
xtable(tabl, caption = "Table 1: Rank correlation measures for PCP ~ Insurance") %>% print(type = "html")
```

  The Pearson chi-squared tests of general association were highly significant (all p < 0.0001) confirming the presence of an association between insurance status and having a personal doctor for every year from 2011 through 2015. Furthermore, the Kendall's tau-b and Goodman and Kruskal's gamma statistics confirm that the direction of this association is towards insured individuals being more likely to have a personal doctor as we would expect. 

Table 1 reports the calculated rank correlation statistics, their confidence intervals, their test-statistics and their p-values for all years combined. For information on the rank correlation statistics for specific years see table A1 in the appendix. The narrow confidence intervals indicate that the positive correlation between insurance status and having a personal doctor is highly *statistically* significant. The difference in the magnitude of the tau-b and gamma statistics is due to the fact that the gamma statistic looks at the difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs relative to the total number of *only discordant or concordant* pairs and as such ties do not effect the gamma statistic. On the other hand, the tau-b statistic does take ties into account. For more information on the performance of the Pearson chi-squared test and the calculation of the rank correlation statistics please see the appendix.

![**Figure 4:** Graphical depiction of the absolute difference in proportion of insured individuals with a doctor compared to uninsured individuals with doctor. The error bars at the top show the 95% confidence intervals for each year. Note that the range of the y-axis is small so that although the estimated absolute differences decrease from 2011 through 2015, the magnitude of the reduction is small. Moreover, it is clear from the error bars that the confidence intervals for each consecutive year overlap with each other. Even the confidence intervals for 2011 and 2015 are close. ](./plots/Difference_in_Props_PD.png)

### Checkup ~ Insurance

![](./plots/Difference_in_Doctor_Utilization.png)

The association between insurance status and doctor utilization was investigated both for all individuals and for individuals who reported having a personal doctor. For both of these groups the Pearson chi-squared test confirmed the presence of an association between insurance status and doctor utilization (all p < 0.0001), while the rank correlation statistics confirmed that the direction of this association was towards individuals with insurance having a general health checkup more recently. For more information on the Pearson chi-squared tests see tables A2 and A3 in the appendix. The large test-statistics and p-values of virtually zero indicate that the association between insurance status and doctor utilization is highly statistically significant, both when looking at all individuals and only individuals with a personal doctor. Table 4 reports the rank correlation statistics for all individuals and for only individuals who reported having a personal doctor when looking at all years combined. For information the concorance statistics for specific years see tables A4 and A5 in the appendix. The large test-statistics and p-values of approximately zero indicate that the positive correlation between insurance status and doctor utilization is highly statistically significant. However, the relatively small magnitudes of the tau-b estimates indicate that the strength of this correlation is not necessarily very strong. Moreover, the strength of the correlation is weaker when considering only individuals who reported having a personal doctor. 


```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- data.frame('Tau-b [95% CI]' = c("0.274  [0.273, 0.275]", "0.146  [0.145, 0.147]"),
                   'Gamma [95% CI]' = c("0.571 [0.567, 0.574]", "0.455 [0.448, 0.461]"))
row.names(tabl) <- c("All individuals", "Those with a personal doctor")
xtable(tabl, caption = "Table 1: Rank correlation measures for Checkup ~ Insurance") %>% print(type = "html")
```

The rank correlation statistics for the relationship between insurance status and time since last general health checkup (doctor utilization). The positive tau-b and gamma statistics indicate that having insurance is correlated with having a checkup more recently. While the large test-statistics and p-values of virtually zero indicate that this correlation is highly statistically significant, the magnitude of the tau-b statistic indicates that the strength of the correlation is not very strong.

For all three measures of primary care accessibility and utilization, the Pearson chi-squared tests confirmed a general association with insurance status. Furthermore, the rank correlation tests showed that the direction of this association was towards individuals with insurance having better primary care access. For more information on how these tests were performed see the example in the appendix.
  
  Now that we have confirmed the presence and direction of association between insurance status and our measures of primary care access, we will examine in more detail the degree of this relationship by examining the absolute and relative diference in proportion who have had a checkup.

<div style="width:500px; height=500px"> ![](./plots/Rel_Diff_CU1Y.png) </div>
<div style="width:500px; height=500px"> ![](./plots/Abs_Diff_CUg5Y.png) </div>
<div style="width:500px; height=500px"> ![](./plots/Rel_Diff_CUg5Y.png) </div>



 Table 7 shows the absolute and relative difference between the proportion of uninsured individuals that have not had a checkup within five years and the proportion of insured individuals that have not. Note that in this case the difference is between uninsured and insured, not the other way around. So, the absolute diference of 0.182 for all individuals means the proportion of insured individuals that have not had a checkup within five years is 0.182 *less* than the proportion of uninsured individuals that have not. For information on specific years see tables A12 - A15 in the [appendix](#proportional-differences). The absolute difference in proportions is much less when considering only individuals with personal doctors than when considering all individuals. However, when we look at the relative difference we see that for both groups (all individuals and only those that have a personal doctor), uninsured individuals are much more likely to not have had a checkup within 5 years than uninsured individuals. Figures 7 and 8 show that the absolute and relative differences in proportion did not change much between years. 
 
 
 The absolute difference between the proportion of uninsured individuals who have not had a general health checkup within five years and insured individuals who have not. The lines at the top of each bar represent the confidence intervals. The difference is measured as the proportion for uninsured indviduals minus the proportion for insured individuals, so a positive difference indicates the the proportion of uninsured that have not had a checkup within five years is greater than the proportion of insured indviduals that have not. Note the plot on the left is when considering all respondents to the BRFSS survey, while the plot on the right is when considering only respondents who reported having a personal doctor. The difference between uninsured and insured is much smaller when only considering individuals that have a personal doctor.
 
 The relative difference between the proportion of uninsured individuals who have not had a general health checkup within five years and insured individuals who have not. The lines at the top of each bar represent the confidence intervals. The difference is measured as the ratio of the proportion of uninsured indviduals that have not had a checkup within five years to the proportion of insured individuals that have not. Thus, a relative difference greater than 1 indicates that uninsured individuals are more likely to not have had a checkup within five years. Note the plot on the left is when considering all respondents to the BRFSS survey, while the plot on the right is when considering only respondents who reported having a personal doctor.
 

 Individuals with health insurance, when looking at all years combined, are estimated to be 2.12 times as likely to have a personal doctor than individuals without insurance. When looking at frequency of general health checkups, individuals with health insurance were 1.84 times as likely to have had checkup within a year. Moreover, uninsured individuals were 3.87 times as likely to have not had a checkup within the past five years. When considering only individuals who reported having a personal doctor the differences, as expected, were lower in magnitude, but still present. Insured individuals with a personal docter were 1.37 times as likely to have had a checkup within a year when compared to uninsured individuals who have a personal docter. Uninsured individuals who reported having a doctor were still 3.29 times as likely to not have had a general health checkup in the last five years than insured individuals with a personal doctor. The 95% confidence intervals for these relative differences in proportion are quite narrow, indicating that the estimated relative differences in proportion are likely close to the actual relative differences in the population.
  
  The degree of the relationship between insurance status and frequency of general health checkups decreased slightly from 2011 to 2015. The relative difference in the proportion of insured individuals who have had a checkup within one year and the proportion of uninsured individuals who have decreased from ~1.90 (95% CI: 1.8806,1.9126) in 2011 to ~1.75 (95% CI: 1.7357, 1.7715) in 2015. However, the relationship between insurance status and the proportion of individuals who have *not* had checkup within five years did not change significantly from 2011 to 2015.
  
 
### Chronic illness DX ~ PCP

We investigated the association between having a primary care docotor (Do you have a personal docotr?) and being diagnosed with one of 11 chronic illnesses: arthritis, asthma, COPD, depression, diabetes, heart attack, high blood pressure, kidney disease, stoke, skin cancer, and cancer other than skin cancer. The questions were generally worded "Have you ever been diagnosed with _____?" Implying that we are measuring prevelence and not incidence.

To investigate the association between having a primary care doctor and the likelihod of being diagnosed with a chronic illness we simply calculated the relative risk of diagnosis (risk in people with a PCP/risk in people with out a PCP). Since age and income are associated with both having a PCP and development of chronic illness we stratified our analysis by these variables. Age was broken into four categories:40-54, 55-65, 65-75, >75. Annual Household income was broken into three categories: <25K, 25-50K, >50K. The ratio of the risk of diagnosis in those with a PCP to the risk of diagnosis in those without a PCP was calculated for each combination of age an income group. The results are shown in figure/table X. These were calculated by combining all years 2011-2015 together in order increase sample size. The results did not appear to differ in a meaningful way from year to year. 

The BRFSS data includes sample weights and the relative risks were calculated using both the raw conts of respondents and the weighted sample. The results were similar.However the confidence intervals differ depending on which method was used. (need to think though this a bit. not sure if we should use standard CI formula with the weighted sample counts).



The relative risk of diagnosis of chronic illness is shown below in figure X. 

![figure x](./plots/facet_plot_all.png)

Nearly all of the relative risk values are (significanlty?) greater than one. In fact most are greater than 1.5. These results are also printed in table X. That is people with a PCP are much more likely than those without a personal docotor to be recieve a diagnosis for a chronic illness or cancer. While it is possible that people without a personal doctor might be healthier it does not seem likely that this accounts for the magnitude and consistancy of under diagnosis across conditions, years, age and income categories. When we examined the risk of being in fair or poor general health between those with a PCP and those without, the difference was small. See table X for these risk ratios. This indicates that people without a PCP are not so much healthier than those without as to account for the striking difference in diagnosis rates.

For some chronic illness the difference in diagnosis rates seems to be more affected by age and income than others. For exmaple the young (40-55)  and poor (<25K) without a PCP are over 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with skin cancer than their counterpats who have a PCP. This difference is almost certainly due underdiagnosis and not a true difference in incidence. 

<div style="width:300px; height=200px">
![](./plots/Odds ratio plot.png)
</div>

In most chronic illness we see the difference between those with a PCP and those without getting smaller as people age. Insurance status certainly changes as people hit age 65 and qualify for Medicare. As a result the number of people without a PCP drops as age increases particularly at the age 65 cutoff. We might hypothesize that one reason the differences disappear as people get older is that those without a PCP at an old age have probably had a PCP at some point in the past and may have had the opportunity to have thier issues diagnosed. It may also be that a survivor effect is taking place. The people who say had undiagnosed skin cancer when they are age 50 may not be alive at age 75, thus causing the sample of people without a PCP to be biased toward healthier people who have surevived without medical care. These are purely speculations and would rewuire followup analysis for futher investigation.






# Discussion
We have shown that there is an association between insurance status and having a PCP. We have also investigated the association between having a PCP and likelihood of diagnosis of a chronic illness or cancer. The extent to which the likelihood of diagnosis differs between those with a PCP and those without across age, income, and condition indicates widespread underdiagnosis of these chronic illnesses and cancer. It would not be difficult to estimate the number of undiagnosed cases of chronic illness by simply assuming the prevelence rates are equal between those with a PCP and those without. (Maybe I'll do this calculaion?). This highlights the  importance of primary care in identifying diagnosing important chronic illnesses. It further highlights the importance of insurance status as a gateway to primary care access. 

  Our measures of primary care access and utilization were all strongly associated with insurance. The relationship between insuance status and primary care utilization was less strong when considering only individuals that have a personal doctor. However, for all three measures having insurance was positively correlated with primary care access and utilization. 

  Our analysis indicates that insurance status in the United States is indeed correlated with better primary care access and utilization. The presence of this relationship is promising because it would imply that as uninsured rates drop in the United States, access to primary care should be expected to rise, and the subsequent improvements in health outcomes and reduction in costs should hopefully follow.


### Over diagnosis in insured or underdiagnosis in uninsured?
